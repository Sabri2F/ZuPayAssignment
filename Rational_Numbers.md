<h1 id="rational-numbers">Rational Numbers</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>You began your study of numbers by counting objects around you. The<br>
numbers used for this purpose were called counting numbers or natural<br>
numbers. They are 1, 2, 3, 4, … By including 0 to natural numbers, we<br>
got the whole numbers, i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3, … The negatives of natural<br>
numbers were then put together with whole numbers to make up<br>
integers. Integers are …, –3, –2, –1, 0, 1, 2, 3, … We, thus, extended<br>
the number system, from natural numbers to whole numbers and from<br>
whole numbers to integers.</p>
<p>You were also introduced to fractions. These are numbers of the form numerator/denominator, where the numerator is either 0 or a positive integer and the denominator, a positive integer.<br>
You compared two fractions, found their equivalent forms and studied all the four basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on them.<br>
In this Chapter, we shall extend the number system further. We shall introduce the concept of rational numbers alongwith their addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations.</p>
<h2 id="need-for-rational-numbers">8.2 NEED FOR RATIONAL NUMBERS</h2>
<p>Earlier, we have seen how integers could be used to denote opposite situations involving numbers. For example, if the distance of 3 km to the right of a place was denoted by 3, then the distance of 5 km to the left of the same place could be denoted by –5. If a profit of  150<br>
was represented by 150 then a loss of  100 could be written as –100.<br>
There are many situations similar to the above situations that involve fractional numbers.<br>
You can represent a distance of 750m above sea level as<br>
3/4 km. Can we represent 750m below sea level in km? Can we denote the distance of 3/4 km below sea level by<br>
3/4? We can see -3/4 is neither an integer, nor a fractional number. We need to extend our number system to include such numbers.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-rational-numbers">8.3 WHAT ARE RATIONAL NUMBERS?</h2>
<p>The word ‘rational’ arises from the term ‘ratio’. You know that a ratio like 3:2 can also be written as 3/2. Here, 3 and 2 are natural numbers.<br>
Similarly, the ratio of two integers p and q (q ≠ 0), i.e., p:q can be written in the form p/q. This is the form in which rational numbers are expressed.<br>
A rational number is defined as a number that can be expressed in the form p/q , where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0.<br>
Thus, 4/5 is a rational number. Here, p = 4 and q = 5.<br>
Is 3/4 also a rational number? Yes, because p = – 3 and q = 4 are integers.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You have seen many fractions like 3/8, 4/8, 1 2/3 etc. All fractions<br>
are rational numbers. Can you say why? How about the decimal numbers<br>
like 0.5, 2.3, etc.? Each of such numbers can be written as an<br>
ordinary fraction and, hence, are rational numbers. For example, 0.5<br>
= 5/10, 0.333 = 333/1000 etc.</p>
<h3 id="numerator-and-denominator">Numerator and Denominator</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In p/q, the integer p is the numerator, and the integer q (≠ 0) is the denominator.<br>
Thus, in -3/7, the numerator is –3 and the denominator is 7.</p>
<p>Mention five rational numbers each of whose</p>
<p>(a) Numerator is a negative integer and denominator is a positive integer.<br>
(b) Numerator is a positive integer and denominator is a negative integer.<br>
(c ) Numerator and denominator both are negative integers.<br>
(d) Numerator and denominator both are positive integers.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Are integers also rational numbers?<br>
Any integer can be thought of as a rational number. For example, the integer –5 is a rational number, because you can write it as -5/1. The integer 0 can also be written as 0= 0/2 or 0/7 etc. Hence, it is also a rational number.<br>
<em>Thus, rational numbers include integers and fractions.</em></p>
<h3 id="equivalent-rational-numbers">Equivalent rational numbers</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A rational number can be written with different numerators and denominators. For example, consider the rational number – 2/3.</p>
<p><em>By multiplying the numerator and denominator of a rational number by the same non zero integer, we obtain another rational number equivalent to the given rational number</em>. This is exactly like obtaining equivalent fractions.</p>
<h2 id="positive-and-negative-rational-numbers">8.4 POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE RATIONAL NUMBERS</h2>
<p>Consider the rational number 2/3. Both the numerator and denominator of this number are positive integers. Such a rational number is called a <strong>positive rational number</strong>. So, 3/8, 5/7, 2/9 etc. are positive rational numbers.<br>
The numerator of –3/5 is a negative integer, whereas the denominator is a positive integer. Such a rational number is called a <strong>negative rational number</strong>. So, -5/7, -3/8,  -9/5 etc. are negative rational numbers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is 8/−3 a negative rational number? We know that 8/−3 = (8× -1)/(-3× -1) = -8/3, and -8/3 is a negative rational number. So, 8/−3 is a negative rational number.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, 5/-7, 6/-5, 2/-9 etc. are all negative rational numbers. Note that their numerators are positive and their denominators negative.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The number 0 is neither a positive nor a negative rational number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What about -3/-5?<br>
You will see that -3/-5 = (-3× -1)/(-5×-1) = 3/5. So, -3/-5 is a positive rational number.<br>
Thus, -2/-5, -5/-3 etc. are positive rational numbers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rational-numbers-on-a-number-line">8.5 RATIONAL NUMBERS ON A NUMBER LINE</h2>
<p>You know how to represent integers on a number line. Let us draw one such number line.</p>
<p>The points to the right of 0 are denoted by + sign and are positive integers. The points to the left of 0 are denoted by – sign and are negative integers.<br>
Representation of fractions on a number line is also known to you.<br>
Let us see how the rational numbers can be represented on a number line.<br>
Let us represent the number −1/2 on the number line.</p>
<p>As done in the case of positive integers, the positive rational numbers would be marked on the right of 0 and the negative rational numbers would be marked on the left of 0.<br>
To which side of 0 will you mark −1/2? Being a negative rational number, it would be marked to the left of 0.<br>
You know that while marking integers on the number line, successive integers are marked at equal intervels. Also, from 0, the pair 1 and –1 is equidistant. So are the pairs 2<br>
and –2, 3 and –3.<br>
In the same way, the rational numbers 1/2 and −1/2 would be at equal distance from 0.</p>
<p>We know how to mark the rational number 1/2. It is marked at a point which is half the distance between 0 and 1. So, −1/2 would be marked at a point half the distance between 0 and –1.</p>
<h2 id="rational-numbers-in-standard-form">8.6 RATIONAL NUMBERS IN STANDARD FORM</h2>
<p>Observe the rational numbers 3/5, -5/8, 2/7, -7/11.<br>
The denominators of these rational numbers are positive integers and 1 is the only common factor between the numerators and denominators. Further, the negative sign occurs only in the numerator.<br>
Such rational numbers are said to be in <strong>standard form</strong>.</p>
<p><em>A rational number is said to be in the standard form if its denominator is a positive integer and the numerator and denominator have no common factor other than 1.</em></p>
<p>If a rational number is not in the standard form, then it can be reduced to the standard form.</p>
<p>Recall that for reducing fractions to their lowest forms, we divided the numerator and the denominator of the fraction by the same non zero positive integer. We shall use the same method for reducing rational numbers to their standard form.</p>
<h2 id="comparison-of-rational-numbers">8.7 COMPARISON OF RATIONAL NUMBERS</h2>
<p>We know how to compare two integers or two fractions and tell which is smaller or which is greater among them. Let us now see how we can compare two rational numbers.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Two positive rational numbers, like 2/3 and 5/7 and can be compared as studied earlier in the case of fractions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mary compared two negative rational numbers −1/2 and −1/5 using number line. She knew that the integer which was on the right side of the other integer, was the greater integer.<br>
For example, 5 is to the right of 2 on the number line and 5 &gt; 2. The integer – 2 is on<br>
the right of – 5 on the number line and – 2 &gt; – 5.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The case of pairs of negative rational numbers is similar. To compare two negative rational numbers, we compare them ignoring their negative signs and then reverse the order.<br>
For example, to compare −7/5 and −5/3, we first compare 7/5 and 5/3.<br>
We get 7/5 &lt; 5/3 and conclude that –7/–5 &gt; -5/3 .<br>
Take five more such pairs and compare them.<br>
Which is greater −3/8 or -2/7?; -4/3 or -3/2?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comparison of a negative and a positive rational number is obvious. A negative rational number is to the left of zero whereas a positive rational number is to the right of zero on a number line. So, a negative rational number will always be less than a positive rational number.<br>
Thus, -2/7 &lt; 1/2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To compare rational numbers -3/-5 and -2/-7 reduce them to their standard forms and then compare them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rational-numbers-between-two-rational-numbers">8.8 RATIONAL NUMBERS BETWEEN TWO RATIONAL NUMBERS</h2>
<p>Reshma wanted to count the whole numbers between 3 and 10. From her earlier classes, she knew there would be exactly 6 whole numbers between 3 and 10. Similarly, she<br>
wanted to know the total number of integers between –3 and 3. The integers between –3 and 3 are –2, –1, 0, 1, 2. Thus, there are exactly 5 integers between –3 and 3.</p>
<p>Are there any integers between –3 and –2? No, there is no integer between –3 and –2. Between two successive integers the number of integers is 0.</p>
<p><em>We can find unlimited number of rational numbers<br>
between any two rational numbers.</em></p>
<h2 id="operations-on-rational-numbers">8.9 OPERATIONS ON RATIONAL NUMBERS</h2>
<p>You know how to add, subtract, multiply and divide integers as well as fractions. Let us now study these basic operations on rational numbers.</p>
<h3 id="addition">8.9.1 Addition</h3>
<p><em>So, we find that while adding rational numbers with same denominators, we add the numerators keeping the denominators same.</em></p>
<p>How do we add rational numbers with different denominators? As in the case of fractions, we first find the LCM of the two denominators. Then, we find the equivalent rational numbers of the given rational numbers with this LCM as the denominator. Then, add the two rational numbers.</p>
<h3 id="subtraction">8.9.2 Subtraction</h3>
<p><em>So, we say while subtracting two rational numbers, we add the additive inverse of the rational number that is being subtracted, to the other rational number.</em></p>
<h3 id="multiplication">8.9.3 Multiplication</h3>
<p><em>So, we find that while multiplying a rational number by a positive integer, we multiply the numerator by that integer, keeping the denominator unchanged.</em></p>
<p>So, as we did in the case of fractions, we multiply two<br>
rational numbers in the following way:<br>
<strong>Step 1</strong> Multiply the numerators of the two rational numbers.<br>
<strong>Step 2</strong> Multiply the denominators of the two rational numbers.<br>
<strong>Step 3</strong> Write the product as Result of Step 1/<br>
Result of Step 2.</p>
<h3 id="division">8.9.4 Division</h3>
<p><em>This shows, to divide one rational number by the other non-zero rational number we multiply the rational number by the reciprocal of the other.</em>``</p>
